This dataset contains tweets from members of 5 different organisations employed to analyse if they use specific languages differentiable among organisations. For the dataset, we gathered organisations that have several members and from diverse fields:

- Organisation A is an NGO focused on humansâ€™ rights.
- Organisation B is a multinational aerospace corporation.
- Organisation C is a multinational professional services network.
- Organisation D is a political party.
- Organisation E is a multinational technology company.

Tweets from organisations D and E are divided because they contain a great number of tweets and exceeded the size limit allowed by Github. To join the files of those organisations in one, use this command:

`cat organisationD_*.csv > organisationD.csv`
